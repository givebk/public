# Terms of Service

*Last updated: May 13, 2022*

IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN SECTION 15.

From everyone at DVQO, thank you for using our products! We build them to help you do your best work. Because we don't know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.

When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to DVQO, LLC.

When we say “GIVEBK” in this document, we are referring to DVQO, LLC.

When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by DVQO, LLC. That includes GIVEBK, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.

When we say “You” or “your” or "user" or "creator", we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.

When we say “Users", we are referring to any people or organizations that own an account (actively or passively) with one or more of our Services.

When we say “Provider”, we are referring to any Company or Site that are integrated with one or more of our Services, such as Github.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all changes made since mid-2022 [on GitHub](https://github.com/givebk/public/commits/master/policies).

# Consideration

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. **These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES. These Terms of Use constitute a legal agreement between you and GIVEBK, and shall apply to your use of the Website and the Services even after termination.

If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about [who we are](https://givebk.io/faq), and keeping an open door to [your feedback](mailto:support@givebk.io).

## Eligibility
In order to use our Services, you must comply with your country's minimum age laws (for example, you must be at least 13 years of age if you live in the United States), to open an account with GIVEBK ("Account"). You must be also physically located in a region who is not facing any US sanctions.

If you are over the age of 13 but are under 18, you can give and receive funds, provided that Stripe, our payment processor, can collect verification information from your legal guardian.

You will not under any circumstances allow payments or raise funds involving:

fraud, ransom, violations of intellectual property, or other illegal purposes;

misrepresentation or deception related to the reasons you're raising funds or requesting sponsorship;

the purchase or sale of ICOs, utility tokens, or other types of cryptocurrency;

the purchase or sale of securities, equity, or other types of investment offers;

the sale of personal information, or the processing of personal information in violation of any laws;

lotteries, raffles, gambling, pyramid schemes, self-dealing, "get rich quick schemes", deceptive marketing schemes, "donation for donation" schemes, or any attempts to game GIVEBK's or third parties' systems or services; and,

activities with, in, or involving countries, regions, governments, persons, or entities that are not permitted under U.S. and other economic sanctions under applicable law.


## Account Terms & Obligations

1.  You will be solely responsible for support, development, and maintenance of your relation with other users, and any complaints about your relation with them.

2. You must register with your true identity, and you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as requested by our Support Team.Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our Privacy Statement, as well as any privacy statement provided by our payment processor.

3. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. GIVEBK cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We recommend users set up [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/pt/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) for added security in your Github account. In some of our Services, we may require it.

4.  In addition, you may be required to register with the payment service provider(s) selected by the Company (such as Stripe) in order to access and use certain features of our Service.

5. You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account. That includes content posted by others who either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own logins under your account.

6. You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.

7. By using our Services you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of any third party payment providers associated with the Platform and they will be responsible for all matters relating to payment and use of your card details.

8. GIVEBK is not and should not be held liable for any damages or losses related to your use of the Services. We don’t become involved in disputes between users, or between users and any third party relating to the use of the Services. When you use the Services, you release GIVEBK from claims, damages, and demands of every kind — known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed — arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and the Services. All content you access through the Services is at your own risk. You’re solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.

## Deposits and Withdrawals Generally

1. By depositing funds, you agree to provide us or or our payment processing partner with a valid mailing address, date of birth and social security number, national tax id and any other information we may require in order to run appropriate identity checks and comply with applicable rules and regulations. If necessary, you may be required to provide appropriate documentation that allows us to verify you. While your account is pending verification, you may be able to deposit funds into your account and make transfer to another users, but you will not be able to withdraw any funds from your account until verification is complete. If we are unable to verify you, we reserve the right to suspend your account and withhold any funds until such time as we have been able to successfully verify you.

2. We also may conduct checks for Terms compliance, including anti-fraud checks on transfer patterns and deposits prior to processing a withdrawal, and we may request additional information before permitting a withdrawal. Subject to such checks, you may close your account and withdraw your balance at any time and for any reason.

3. Deposits, and received transfers, are held in a separate, segregated bank account by Stripe. These funds belong to you, subject to review for evidence of fraud, verification or other prohibited conduct as described above, and GIVEBK may not use them to cover its operating expenses. Your withdrawals will be made by the payment service provider(s) options selected by the Company (such as Stripe Connect).

## Transaction Limits

1. The use of all GIVEBK services may be subject to a limit on the amount of volume, stated in U.S. Dollar terms, you may transact or transfer in a given period (e.g., daily). Your transaction limits may vary depending on your payment method, verification steps you have completed, and other factors. If you wish to raise your limits beyond the posted amounts, you may [contact our Support team](mailto:support@givebk.io). GIVEBK reserves the right to change applicable limits, and to refuse to raise your limits, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion.

## Taxes
1. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the Donations, Subscriptions and Sales you receive through your use of the services. It is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report or remit the correct tax, if any, to the appropriate tax authority.

2. GIVEBK intends to comply with all applicable tax information reporting and tax withholding laws that GIVEBK reasonably determines in its judgment apply to these payments. If taxes are required to be withheld on any amounts to be paid by GIVEBK to you or from amounts which are subject to tax information reporting under applicable laws, GIVEBK will deduct such taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority and, as required, will secure and deliver to you an official receipt for any such taxes withheld as required under applicable laws. 
GIVEBK will use reasonable efforts to minimize such taxes to the extent permissible under applicable law, and each party will reasonably cooperate with the other to obtain the lowest tax rates or elimination of such taxes pursuant to the applicable income tax laws or treaties. This includes you providing to GIVEBK adequate information required under applicable laws, such as IRS Forms W-8, W-9, or other information to establish exemptions from withholding. You will also be responsible for complying with any third-party payment processor’s terms and conditions. Furthermore, GIVEBK reserves the right to suspend payments to your account until you provide GIVEBK with adequate documentation or information required under applicable laws for GIVEBK to determine any applicable tax withholding or reporting obligations that apply to the payments under these Additional Terms or Agreement.

## Refund Policy

1. Deposits made on the Service will appear on your statement as DVQO or GIVEBK. All payments are final. No refunds will be issued.

## Temporary Accounts

1. GIVEBK creates a temporary account in the following scenario:

When you transfer funds to an account that has not yet actively registered with us (using OAuth authentication i.e), but account exists in the Provider. GIVEBK acts as custodian of that account until the user registered on the Provider takes possession of that temporary account. All sections described in these Terms of Service are applied this temporary account.

2. The user who has a valid account on the Provider can get access to the temporary account on his behalf at any time, just by connecting to GIVEBK using the provider's OAuth integration, through the website https://givebk.io.

3. After the user interacts in any way with our services (authenticating via OAuth or interacting with our bot), he takes possession of the temporary account, and this account is no longer considered temporary nor under the custody of GIVEBK.

## Fees

1. Creating an account on GIVEBK is free. If you account send,receive or withdrawal funds, we (and our payment partners) can collect fees. Our partners’ fees may vary slightly based on your location. Each payment provider is its own company, and GIVEBK isn’t responsible for its performance. You’re responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with your use of GIVEBK.

2. We reserve the right to change our fees and charge additional fees in the future for any type of transaction. We shall charge fees in relation to applicable subscriptions and transactions, as listed from time to time on our site. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that GIVEBK does not identify itself as the seller of User Content, Memberships or any other goods or services, and that GIVEBK is not a party to any Donation solicited by a User. You agree that any purchases or Donations you make on our site are with User, who act as third-party sellers identified on the GIVEBK platform.

3. Users may be required to pay fees for subscriptions – you will be notified of the subscription fees at the time of entering into your subscription. Please note that the type of subscription you choose may impact your transaction fees. Depending on subscription or type of transaction, GIVEBK may not take any fees, subject to us reserving the right to charge additional fees in the future for any type of subscription, transaction, purchase or donation.

4. For other types of subscription, transaction or any other GIVEBK feature, we may charge fees. All applicable transaction fees in relation to User Content, Donations, Memberships or any other goods or services, shall automatically be deducted from the relevant transaction by one of our third-party payment providers.

## Account Inactivity Fee

1. Your account will be deemed 'Inactive' if you have not logged in for a period of one hundred and eighty days (180) days. GIVEBK will assess fee of $10 or 5% of account balance per month on all inactive accounts until the account is reactivated by making a transfer, making a deposit, or withdrawing funds. GIVEBK will provide all users subject to an inactivity fee with at least thirty (30) days notice prior to deducting any fees.

2. If your account remains inactive for the amount of time specified by applicable state law, usually between thirty-six (36) and sixty (60) months, it will be considered abandoned. Once an account is abandoned, GIVEBK is required by state law to remit the abandoned funds to the appropriate state agency as unclaimed property. GIVEBK may also charge additional fees associated with the delivery of abandoned funds to the applicable state agency.

## Cancellation and Termination

1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within each of our Services. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help cancelling your account, you can always [contact our Support team](mailto:support@givebk.io).

2. All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account cancellation. If you want to export any data before your account is cancelled, please [contact our Support team](mailto:support@givebk.io).

3. We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious.

4. Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.

## Modifications to the Service

1. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.


## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for most of our Services — but do take uptime of our applications seriously. Visit [https://status.givebk.io/](https://status.givebk.io/) to see the status of our Services.

2. We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we'll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.

3. We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted. To report a security incident or threat, please [email us](mailto:support@givebk.io})

4. When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that GIVEBK may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/givebk/public/blob/master/policies/privacy/index.md) and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:
  - **To help you with support requests you make.** We'll ask for express consent before accessing your account.
  - **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.** We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause as much as possible to avoid the errors from reoccurring.
  - **To safeguard DVQO.** We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an abuse report investigation.
  - **To the extent required by applicable law.** As a US company with all data infrastructure located in the US, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act. If a non-US authority approaches DVQO for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If DVQO is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.

5. We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all subprocessors who handle personal data for [GIVEBK](https://github.com/givebk/public/blob/master/policies/privacy/subprocessors/index.md).

6. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), GIVEBK is a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms of Service, [Privacy policy](https://github.com/givebk/public/blob/master/policies/privacy/index.md), and [other policies](https://github.com/givebk/public/blob/master/policies). We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under the CCPA and not use GIVEBK’s Services in a way that violates the regulations.


## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright law.

2. We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Services. All materials uploaded remain yours.

3. We do not pre-screen content, but reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.

4. The names, look, and feel of the Services are copyright© to the Company. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written permission from the Company. You must request permission to use the Company's logo or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please [email us](mailto:support@givebk.io}) requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind this permission if you violate these Terms of Service.

5. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission by the Company.

6. You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Services or the Company.

## Features and Bugs

1. We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

2. We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely error-free Services.

## Dispute Resolution & Indemnity

1. We at GIVEBK encourage you to contact us if you’re having an issue, before resorting to the courts. In the unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these Terms (and all other rules, policies, or guidelines incorporated by reference) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, and without application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act or the United Nations Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods.

2. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless GIVEBK, Our subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and Our officers, directors, employees, partners, contractors, representatives, agents, and third party providers from and against any and all claims, causes of action, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) and all amounts paid in settlement arising from or relating to, breach of these Terms or violation of any applicable laws. We reserve the right, in Our sole discretion and at Our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you have agreed to indemnify us and you agree to assist and cooperate with us as reasonably required in the defense or settlement of any such matters.

## Liability

We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

***You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.***

In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that's on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general. If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.

If you have a question about any of the Terms of Service, please [contact our Support team](mailto:support@givebk.io).
